# Introduction to PYNQ-Z2 Development

Welcome to my PYNQ-Z2 project! This repository contains my efforts to explore and utilize the PYNQ-Z2 board, a versatile and powerful platform designed for Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoCs. The PYNQ-Z2 board stands out for its ability to be programmed in Python, making FPGA and hardware acceleration accessible to software developers without a background in hardware language.

This project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of the PYNQ-Z2 board through various applications, ranging from simple GPIO control, like blinking LEDs, to more complex hardware acceleration tasks (which I will push in the future!). I believe that by sharing my learning joiurney in a simplified manner with examples and documentation, I can help others learn and build upon the PYNQ-Z2 platform.

Whether you're new to FPGA development or looking to see what the PYNQ-Z2 board can do, you'll find resources here to start your journey.
